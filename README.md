# React Travel Journal - Learning Project

## Purpose

This is a **learning and practice project** to understand React fundamentals, including:
- Creating and using React components
- Passing data through props
- Mapping over arrays to render lists
- JSX syntax and component composition

## What I'm Learning

- **React Components**: Breaking UI into reusable components (Navbar, TravelCard)
- **Props**: Passing data from parent to child components
- **Array Methods**: Using `.map()` to render lists of components
- **JSX**: Writing JavaScript expressions in JSX

## Project Structure

- `App.jsx` - Main component that renders the navbar and travel cards
- `component/Navbar.jsx` - Navigation bar component
- `component/TravelCard.jsx` - Individual travel card component
- `data.js` - Travel data array

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser to the local URL shown in the terminal

## Note

This is a **practice/learning project**, not a production application. The code reflects my learning journey with React basics.
